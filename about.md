Hi, I'm JP. Based in Sydney.

I spent 15 years in fintech - Oracle, PayPal, Intuit - across pre-sales, sales, partnerships, solution architecture, product management, developer advocacy, and engineering, helping businesses and consumers manage their money. Eventually it occurred to me I should probably sort out my own finances before advising others.

So I pivoted. Learned everything I could about python, markets, trading, and risk management. Built a platform to automate my investments and eliminate the main source of risk: me. 

Bar a handful of wealthy people who can afford competent financial advisors, most of us are stuck with mediocre ones who charge a fee for the privilege of underperforming the index. Makes sense if you think about it - if they were really good at investing, they'd invest their own money from the comfort of their Cayman island villa instead of advertising about how they can manage yours above a nail salon. 

With AI and agentic coding, the ambitious goal I started chipping at pre-AI world in 2019 feels much more achievable now. While the tools I have built are closed sourced and available for Friends and Family only, I wanted to track and share my learnings and thought process in a blog, in the hope that it can help others take control of their finances and avoid the same pitfalls. HINT: **don't do it. Focus on what you're good at and max up your monthly Index fund payment, you'd do better on average**. If you're reading this blog, chances are you didn't read the last sentence, and are looking for a more hands-on approach. 


If you are based in Sydney and building something interesting in the intersection of finance and technology, I would love to connect, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jplemoussu/).
