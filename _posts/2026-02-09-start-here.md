## Why write a blog?

As I write this in 2026, I've been working on an automated platform to manage my investments for over three years. The idea behind this blog is to record my journey, organise my thoughts, and perhaps more importantly, provide a guidebook to my children so they don't repeat the same mistakes I made.

With the rise of agentic coding, by leaving a trace of my learnings and thought process, anyone with access to the codebase should be able to maintain it or rewrite it in whatever language is popular in the future. Technology changes, but financial markets are a necessity to any successful economy. The underlying human behaviours that drive them - greed and fear - are timeless. The investment and risk management principles I've implemented should remain applicable for a long time to come.

## What content will I write about?

Mmm, not sure. I can tell you what I *won't* write about: soulless LinkedIn self-promotion slop. There are plenty of fake engineers out there who rehash the same spaghetti code tutorials, pretending to be an expert in whatever tech is buzzing this week. Instead, I'll focus on core concepts for understanding financial markets and designing systematic trading systems - hence the name "Beyond Algos". I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'll be candid about my mistakes and uncertainties, updating and referring back to old posts as I learn.


## What got me into equity markets?

Whether you like it or not, financial markets control your quality of life - quite literally. I learned this early in my career when I was made redundant as a result of a stock activist: Carl Icahn. I was working at PayPal, pre-eBay split. During the reshuffle, they decided to close APAC product management and centralise it back to the US. In a weird butterfly effect, an old decrepit man attending a board meeting and pushing a short-term profit agenda caused a chain reaction that resulted in me losing my job.

In typical Silicon Valley HR style, I came up to the office one morning, got summoned to a meeting room on a different floor, and was asked to hand over my access card. Perfect timing - my wife had our first baby on the way, and we'd just started repayments on our first home.

On the positive side, after seven years I'd accumulated a bunch of PayPal shares which were suddenly growing fast due to rising interest in the fintech industry. On second thought, maybe I should also become an old decrepit man who understands markets and turn the tables, rather than be at the mercy of one in a precarious job. It was clear I had to figure out this stock market thing, using my employee shares as starting capital. Being in tech, I decided to focus on the US market since the ASX is mostly banks and miners, which I knew nothing about.

## Why did I code my own trading system?

In a word: naivety. Actually, more likely, there were no off-the-shelf solutions that could do what I wanted: trade with a risk-management-first approach.

I started trading manually, mostly using technical analysis<sup>1</sup> and basic fundamental research. Due to timezone differences, trading the US market from Australia is exhausting. Drawing silly lines on a chart, setting up buy/sell orders, and hoping whatever I bought would be up when I woke up.

<sup>1</sup> *Technical analysis in a nutshell. A lot of it is made up nonsense, but some concepts like momentum and trendlines hold up and are essential for algorithmic trading.*

What I didn't realise is that investing is essentially a mentally draining chain of decisions: Buy? Sell? Do nothing?

Why couldn't I offload all this mental load to a computer? Surely I could learn Python, run some pandas operations, and get insanely rich? Keep reading to find out how that turned out.
